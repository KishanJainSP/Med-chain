## 🚀 Project Overview

Healthcare systems today suffer from fragmented data storage, security vulnerabilities, lack of transparency, and inefficient administrative processes.  
MedChain solves these problems by combining:

- **Blockchain** for secure, tamper-proof, and decentralized medical records
- **AI/ML models** for diagnosis, prediction, and clinical decision support
- **Smart contracts** for automation of consent, access control, and insurance workflows

The system empowers patients, doctors, and institutions with a unified, intelligent, and privacy-preserving healthcare ecosystem.
